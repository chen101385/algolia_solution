# Project Title
Algolia Solutions Engineer take-home assignment.

Project Description:

This is a front-end application that mirrors a 'type-as-you-search' interface for OpenTable.

## Getting Started

To get started, download this repo!

### Requirements

The only requirement of this application is the Node Package Manager. All other dependencies can be installed with:

```
npm install
```

### Basic Configuration

This app uses Webpack which takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. In order for your app to render you will need to first bundle your modules using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

The console should print out the environment variable you just exported. 

### Running the App

Initalize your server:

```
npm run nodemon
```

## Testing

```
npm test
```

## Deployment

Currently, a work in progress.

Question 1: 

Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

•	Records
•	Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hi George!

Don’t worry, Algolia has a search solution that fits every need, regardless of level of technical skill or experience. I would be happy to assist you in improving your understanding these two concepts.

RECORDS

So, at Algolia, when you upload your searchable data, we store your information in an index. This information is separated into individual records, which are JSON schema-less objects.  Each record contains one or more attributes that can be selected for searching, displaying, filtering or ranking your data.

INDEXING

Indexing is the act of importing your existing dataset into Algolia’s hosted search platform.  You can ‘index’ your data in the following ways.

•	Through the API (recommended)
•	Algolia’s dashboard
•	Through a Third-Party Platform

Once you complete the indexing process, your ‘index’ will become fully accessible within Algolia’s search platform. 

CUSTOM RANKINGS

We designed the custom ranking option to allow users to input relevant business metrics to rank their search results more effectively.  Therefore, any business metric that is relevant to an end-user could be considered. (i.e. number of likes or reviews)
Custom rankings behave the same way as the rest of the ranking criteria.  You can set either a numerical or Boolean value that represents the relative relevance of your records.  

i.e. for e-commerce, adding availability or popularity to ensure that in-stock and popular items are ranked highest.

In order for numerical custom rankings to function properly within our tie-breaking system, their level of precision should be calibrated in a manner that allows for ‘ties’ between records (precision reduction).

    i.e. if a customer ranking metric is too ‘precise’, then the next custom metric will essentially be ignored.  

Therefore, precision reduction allows tie-breaking to be effectively leveraged. 

    i.e. using only one decimal point, instead of two or more, creates more ‘ties’ where the next custom ranking criterion will be considered. 

If you have any other questions that I can assist you with, please do not hesitate to reach out!

Best,

Christopher Chen

Question 2: 

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

RESPONSE # 2:

Dear Matt,

I apologize for any frustrations that you may have experienced when using our dashboard. We have several alternative methods to edit, clear and delete indexes where you do not have to interact with the dashboard UI. For instance, one simple way to manage your indices that requires no ‘clicking’ is to leverage our API.

I provided a few relevant links:


Ecosystem Overview – see: Indexing & Configuration for a list of ways to manage and synchronize your indices. 
(https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/ecosystem-overview/)


Indexing Overview – how to index via API or Third-Party Platform
(https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/indexing-overview/)


Index Synchronization – how to update or delete records through the API

Here at Algolia, we strive to continually iterate and optimize our product offerings to ensure the best possible experience for our users.  I will pass along your feedback to our product team so that they can make any necessary changes to improve the usability and design of our dashboard.     

Warmest Regards,

Question 3: 

Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo

Question 1: 

Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

•	Records
•	Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, 

George

RESPONSE # 1:

Dear George,

No need to worry! Algolia's search solution is tailored to practically every level of technical skill and experience. I would be more than happy to assist you in improving your understanding of these two core concepts.


RECORDS

When you upload your searchable data to Algolia's platform, we store your information in an index. Within this index, your information is separated into individual records. Each record contains one or more attributes that can be selected for either searching, displaying, filtering or ranking your data.


INDEXING

Indexing is the act of importing your existing dataset onto Algolia’s hosted search platform.  You can ‘index’ your data in the following ways:

•	Through our API (recommended)
•	Algolia’s dashboard
•	Through a Third-Party Platform

Once you complete the indexing process, your ‘index’ will become fully accessible within Algolia’s search platform. 


CUSTOM RANKINGS

We designed the custom ranking option to allow users to input relevant business metrics to rank their search results more effectively.  Therefore, any business metric that is relevant to an end-user could potentially be considered. 

    i.e. Number of likes or reviews.


Custom rankings behave the same way as the rest of our ranking criteria.  You can set either a numerical or Boolean value that represents the relative relevance of your records.  

    i.e. For e-commerce, adding availability or popularity to ensure that in-stock and popular items are ranked highest.


In order for numerical custom rankings to function properly within our tie-breaking system, their level of precision must be calibrated in a manner that allows for ‘ties’ between competing records (precision reduction).

    i.e. If a customer ranking metric is too ‘precise’, there will rarely be any 'ties' and the next custom metric will essentially be ignored.  


Therefore, the process of precision reduction allows tie-breaking to be more effectively leveraged. 

    i.e. Using only one decimal point, instead of two or more, creates more ‘ties’ that allow the next custom ranking criterion to be considered. 


If you have any further questions that I can assist you with, please do not hesitate to reach out!

Question 2: 

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, 

Matt

RESPONSE # 2:

Dear Matt,

I deeply apologize for any frustrations you may have experienced when using our dashboard. I would like to take this opportunity to point out a few alternative methods to edit, clear and delete indexes that do not involve interaction with the dashboard UI. For instance, one popular way of managing your indices that requires no ‘clicking’ is by leveraging our API.

I provided a few relevant links:


Ecosystem Overview – see: 'Indexing & Configuration' section for a list of ways to manage and synchronize your indices. 
(https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/ecosystem-overview/)


Indexing Overview – how to index via API or a Third-Party Platform.
(https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/indexing-overview/)


Index Synchronization – how to update or delete records through the API.
(https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/synchronization/)


Here at Algolia, we strive to continually iterate and optimize our product offerings to ensure the best possible experience for our users.  I will pass along your feedback to our product team so that they can make any necessary changes to improve the usability and design of our dashboard.    


Warmest Regards,
